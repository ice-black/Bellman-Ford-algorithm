# Bellman-Ford-algorithm

This is a simple python based project using bellman-ford algorithim to find the shortest path between two locations.

Finding the best route for a driver between two locations
The algorithm is applied to a weighted graph representing the road network, with the weights representing the
distances and other factors such as traffic and road conditions.
